# GP_2023

## At the end tho, the final version is on another device of one of the members that I don't remember which one was it (you can still run this I guess). I will update this GitHub repository when I find that version.

To run this:

```shell
python main.py
```

## This is the source code for the Group Project 2023
## Project title: Object detection and distance estimation for vision-impaired people

We aim to provide business analysis and research for real-world implementation
